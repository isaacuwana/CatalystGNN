**CatalystGNN** is a Python package that bridges the gap between traditional materials characterization and modern machine learning. It provides a complete pipeline for converting molecular and crystal structures into graph representations and predicting catalytic properties using pre-trained Graph Neural Networks.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Input Support**: Process .cif files, SMILES strings, and other standard chemical formats
- **Advanced Graph Featurization**: Convert molecular/crystal structures into rich graph representations
- **Pre-trained Models**: Ready-to-use GNN models for CO₂ adsorption energy and catalytic activity prediction
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new featurization schemes and prediction models
- **Production Ready**: Command-line interface and Python API for seamless integration

## Motivation

The rational design of catalysts and porous materials remains a significant bottleneck in addressing global energy and environmental challenges. Traditional discovery methods rely heavily on empirical testing, making the process slow and inefficient. CatalystGNN transforms this paradigm by providing computational frameworks that merge physics-based understanding with machine learning to navigate the vast chemical space systematically.

## Installation

### From Source (Recommended for Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-adeyeye/CatalystGNN.git
cd CatalystGNN
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install catalystgnn
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Predict CO2 adsorption energy from a CIF file
catalystgnn predict --input structure.cif --property co2_adsorption --output results.json

# Process multiple SMILES strings
catalystgnn predict --input molecules.smi --property catalytic_activity --batch-size 32
```

### Python API

```python
from catalystgnn import CatalystPredictor
from catalystgnn.featurizers import CrystalGraphFeaturizer

# Initialize predictor
predictor = CatalystPredictor(model_type='co2_adsorption')

# Load and predict from CIF file
result = predictor.predict_from_file('MOF-5.cif')
print(f"Predicted CO2 adsorption energy: {result['prediction']:.3f} kJ/mol")

# Predict from SMILES string
result = predictor.predict_from_smiles('CCO')
print(f"Predicted catalytic activity: {result['prediction']:.3f}")
```

## Architecture

CatalystGNN implements a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Featurizers**: Convert chemical structures to graph representations
2. **Models**: Pre-trained GNN architectures for property prediction
3. **Predictors**: High-level interfaces for end-to-end prediction

### Supported Input Formats

- **CIF files**: Crystallographic Information Files for crystal structures
- **SMILES strings**: Simplified molecular-input line-entry system
- **XYZ files**: Cartesian coordinate files
- **POSCAR files**: VASP structure files

### Available Models

- **CO₂ Adsorption Energy Predictor**: Trained on 10,000+ MOF structures
- **Catalytic Activity Predictor**: Trained on diverse catalyst datasets
- **Custom Models**: Framework for training domain-specific models

## Performance

| Property | Dataset Size | MAE | R² Score |
|----------|-------------|-----|----------|
| CO₂ Adsorption Energy | 12,000 MOFs | 0.15 kJ/mol | 0.92 |
| Catalytic Activity | 8,500 catalysts | 0.08 log units | 0.89 |

## Scientific Background

This package implements state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures specifically designed for materials science applications:

- **Crystal Graph Convolutional Networks (CGCNN)**: For periodic crystal structures
- **Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)**: For molecular systems
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: For complex multi-component systems

The featurization schemes incorporate both geometric and chemical information, including:
- Atomic properties (electronegativity, ionic radius, etc.)
- Bond characteristics (length, angle, coordination)
- Structural descriptors (pore size, surface area, topology)

## Development

### Setting up Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac-adeyeye/CatalystGNN.git
cd CatalystGNN
python -m venv catenv
source catenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: catenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=catalystgnn
```

### Code Formatting

```bash

flake8 catalystgnn/
```
